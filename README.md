# üèó BG Hardware Node


The primary purpose of purchasing a 2TB hard drive workstation is to expand data storage capacity. This is crucial for preventing data loss and ensuring that there is ample space for data accumulation over time. Reliable storage is essential for maintaining the integrity and accessibility of data.

### Current Node Status and Future Plans

The current node has successfully completed its initial sync, marking a significant milestone in our setup. With the new 2TB storage, the node is now prepared to handle additional data accumulation and support ongoing operations. Looking forward, we aim to run more background (BG) nodes to further enhance our network's robustness and reliability. The expanded storage capacity provided by the 2TB workstation will be instrumental in achieving this goal, enabling us to manage multiple nodes efficiently and ensure continuous, high-performance operations.
